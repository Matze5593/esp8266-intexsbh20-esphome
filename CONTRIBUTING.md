# How to contribute to the Intex PureSpa WiFi remote control project

To get an overview of the project, start by reading the [README](README.md).

## Issues

If you spot a problem, have a question or want to suggest an improvement,
please search if a similar or identical issue already exists. If you cannot find
something, you can open a new issue.

Respect the [GitHub Cummunity Code of Conduct](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-code-of-conduct).

Do not promote external projects where you or persons affiliated with you
are invested commercially. If you think such a promotion might support
this project, open an issue to request permission.

## Merge Requests (Bugs, Features)

- Merge requests containing cosmetical changes in lines without functional
  changes will not be accepted. Do not use auto-formatters to "beautify"
  existing code. Stay with the existing coding and formatting style.

- Keep the changes for one pull request limited to one feature only.

- Base your merge request on the latests commit from develop branch and
  create a merge request to the *develop* branch (and not to the master
  branch). When a merge request cannot be handled by the maintainers
  immediately it might become necessary to repeat this process if other
  updates have been added to the project in the meantime.

- In case of a new feature consider adding to the documentation in
  the [README](README.md).

- If the code or resources you plan to contribute are you own, you agree that
  they will be made available under the license of this project.
  
- If the code or resources you plan to contribute have been in part or whole
  created by others, you have full legal responsibility to a) check the license
  compatibility with this project, b) make changes to the contribution to
  resolve existing licensing conflicts and c) provide the required contribution
  information, e.g. for the
  [Licenses and Credits](https://github.com/jnsbyr/esp8266-intexsbh20?tab=readme-ov-file#licenses-and-credits)
  part of the README.
